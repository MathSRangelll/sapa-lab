\chapter{Conclusion}

This lab demonstrated the effectiveness of the Laplace Transform and LTSpice simulations in analyzing and designing circuits. The step-by-step procedure validated theoretical predictions through simulation and experiment. The approach provided valuable insights into frequency and time-domain responses for RLC and op-amp circuits, highlighting the practical application of Laplace Transform in circuit analysis.
