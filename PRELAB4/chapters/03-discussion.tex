\section{Analytical Results}

The calculated capacitor value, voltage, and currents  and  are based on phasor-domain principles. These results highlight the phase differences and magnitude relationships inherent in RLC circuits operating at a specific frequency.

\section{Simulation Analysis}
The SPICE simulation provides a practical visualization of the circuitâ€™s behavior. Waveforms for  and  demonstrate the phase shifts due to the reactive components, while  and  reflect the current distribution through the circuit.
