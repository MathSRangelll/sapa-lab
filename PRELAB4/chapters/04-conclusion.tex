\chapter{Conclusion}

This pre-lab exercise has provided a comprehensive approach to understanding RLC circuit dynamics. By combining phasor-domain analysis with SPICE simulations, we have:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Determined the capacitor value  required for circuit functionality.
    \item Calculated key voltage and current parameters.
    \item Visualized the circuitâ€™s behavior through simulation.
\end{itemize}

These steps ensure \textbf{readiness for the lab experiment} and a deeper understanding of the theoretical and practical considerations of RLC circuits.
