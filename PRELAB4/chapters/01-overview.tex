\section{Objective}

This pre-lab report focuses on analyzing and simulating an RLC circuit, as shown in Figure 1. The circuit is described by the equation $V_R + V_L = 2\cos (\omega t - 7.5)$ with a frequency of $f = 1kHz, \omega = 2\pi \times 10^3 \frac{\text{rad}}{\text{s}}$. The objectives include calculating the capacitor value $C$ and determining the phasor-domain voltage and current values ($V_C$, $I_i$, and $I_o$). Additionally, the circuit will be simulated in LTspice to observe the waveforms for voltages $V_C$ and $V_L$, as well as currents $I_i$ and $I_o$.
