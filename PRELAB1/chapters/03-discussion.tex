\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{P1 Observations:} The AC Sweep analysis demonstrated that the op-amp maintained stable gain at low frequencies but began to attenuate as the frequency approached 1 kHz.
    \item \textbf{P2 Observations:} The Frequency Response analysis showed that the op-amp maintained stable gain at low frequencies but began to attenuate as the frequency approached 1 kHz. 
    \item \textbf{P3 Observations:} The non-inverting amplifier design performed well, maintaining a gain of 4 as expected
\end{itemize}
