\chapter{Conclusion}

The lab successfully demonstrated key characteristics of op-amps, including frequency response and voltage saturation effects. Analytical calculations closely matched experimental results, confirming the accuracy of the models used to predict op-amp behavior. Understanding these characteristics is essential for designing reliable op-amp circuits in practical applications.
