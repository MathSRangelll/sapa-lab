\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Comparison of Analytical and Simulated Results:} The derived transfer function $H(s)$ accurately predicted the frequency and transient responses observed in LTSpice simulations.
    \item \textbf{Frequency Response:} The AC Sweep analysis showed that Laplace transform and transfer functions are effective tools for analyzing frequency response that simplifies the process of determining the circuit's behavior at different frequencies.
    \item \textbf{Step Response:} The transient response of the circuit was analyzed using the step response of the circuit. The step response showed that the circuit is stable and has a fast response time.
    \item \textbf{Op-Amp Circuit Behavior:} The op-amp circuit was analyzed using the transfer function $H(s)$ and the transient response of the circuit. The circuit was found to be stable and had a fast response time. Poles and zeros of the transfer function were used to analyze the stability and characteristics of the circuit and it matched with the results.
