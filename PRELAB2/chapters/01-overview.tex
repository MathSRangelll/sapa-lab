\chapter{Overview}

\section{Objective}
This report details the analytical and simulation-based investigation of two circuits. The first involves calculating the value of a resistor ($R_1$) such that the voltage across a given resistor ($R_3$) in a resistive network is 3.8V. The second part explores the behavior of an RC circuit, focusing on the phase shift between input and output voltages as the frequency varies. Simulations were performed to verify theoretical predictions and compare results across different frequencies.
