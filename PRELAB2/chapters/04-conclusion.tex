\chapter{Conclusion}

This lab effectively demonstrated the use of analytical methods and simulations to analyze both resistive networks and RC circuits. In the resistive network, the desired voltage was achieved through careful calculation and verified by simulation. In the RC circuit, the phase shift behavior was investigated across a range of frequencies, and results aligned with theoretical predictions. These exercises underscored the importance of both manual calculations and simulations in understanding circuit behavior. The combination of theory and simulation tools like LTSpice offers a comprehensive approach to electrical circuit analysis.
