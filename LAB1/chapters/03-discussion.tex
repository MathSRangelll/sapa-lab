\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{P1 Observations:} The AC Sweep analysis demonstrated that the op-amp maintained stable gain at low frequencies but began to attenuate as the frequency approached 1 kHz. Experimental results also confirmed the situation. Slight differences in the gain of experimental and theoretical analysis can be due to the tolerances of the components used in the circuit.
    \item \textbf{P2 Observations:} The Frequency Response analysis showed that the op-amp maintained stable gain at low frequencies but began to attenuate as the frequency approached 1 kHz. Experimental results also confirmed the situation. As we increased the frequency, output signal started to lag behind the input signal. This is due to the phase shift of the op-amp.
    \item \textbf{P3 Observations:} The non-inverting amplifier design performed well, maintaining a gain of 4 as expected and also comfirmed by the experimental results.
\end{itemize}
